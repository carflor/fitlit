# FitLit Project 

The focus of this project was to use OOP and TDD to develop the application. 

We were asked to build a web application to display user data for a fitness tracker called FitLit. This application keeps track of daily Sleep, Hydration, and Activity data points for the User and is able to display the data and compare it to all user averages, as well as the users friends data. 

We used JavaScript for building the application and we used MOCHA and CHAI for testing the application functionality.
